# MulberryLab-backend
 MulberryLab is my final year individual research project designed and  implemented using deep learning and computer vision techniques. The system  identifies red Sri Lankan and foreign mulberry varieties, detects leaf diseases  using YOLOv10 and ResNet50, and offers a React-Flask web solution to support  farmers, researchers, and conservationists.
