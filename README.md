# MulberryLab-backend
 MulberryLab is my final year individual research project designed and  implemented using deep learning and computer vision techniques. The system  identifies red Sri Lankan and foreign mulberry varieties, detects leaf diseases  using YOLOv10 and ResNet50, and offers a React-Flask web solution to support  farmers, researchers, and conservationists. 

Server-side application built with Flask, powering MulberryLabâ€™s features such as mulberry counting, disease detection, farmer guidance, and community support. Integrates YOLOv10, ResNet50, and PostgreSQL to provide robust APIs for the frontend.
